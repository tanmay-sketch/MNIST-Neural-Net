# MNIST-Neural-Net
Built an MNIST Neural Network Classifier with 88% accuracy

This repository contains an Neural Network for the MNIST database, built just using numpy and math. It is a great way of understanding deep learning concepts. Just through this activity I was able to understand the fundamentals of Neural Networks. 

--------------- STEPS TO BUILD THE NEURAL NETWORK -----------------

1. Loading the data and splitting the data into training and testing. (Shuffling the data before splitting the data)
2. Creating the functions for different steps in the neural network
	* Initialize parameters
	* Activation Function (ReLU) 
	* Forward Propagation
	* Derivative of Activation function
	* One Hot function
	* Backword propagation
	* Updating the parameters
	* Gradient descent
	* Predictions and Accuracy Functions
3. Running the gradient descent and finding out the accuracy of the model
